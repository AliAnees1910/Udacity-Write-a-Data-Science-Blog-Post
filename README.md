# PROJECT SUMMARY
This Project aims to analze Airbnb data; sliced to only contain seattle data in specific time interval. 
the goal here is to answer not less than 3 business question to submit on udacity platform as part of data science nano degree.
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

* **Listings**, including full descriptions and average review score
* **Reviews**, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* **Calendar**, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

In This Project, we need to answer 4 questions:

* what is the busiest month in terms of availbility of listings ?
* when is the highest aver price of listings per night ?
* Where are the most expensive listings ? at which neighbourhoods in Seattle
* Who are the top host names and what are the types of listings they offer ?
# Summary of the results 
The business is good all over the year but it's at the peak in March,November,December and January.However, the most expensive time to book is in June,July and August which accordingly accompanied by low available listings, this is to keep profit constant as much as hosts can. 
Also airbnb allowed people to build their business with help of airbnb platform, as it's noted that there are hosts with more than 50 listings in Seattle.

Last thing, if you want to get listing and enjoy luxurious visit, go to fairmount park neighbourhood, costy but worth it!. if you are not interested and you want the cheapest prices , go to roxhill or olympic hills but with less amenties properties.
